While OLS can be useful for exploring associations between variables, it is not always sufficient for determining causality. There are several reasons why OLS may not be a reliable indicator of causality.\\\\n\\\\nFirstly, OLS assumes that there are no omitted variables or unobserved confounders that could bias the estimated coefficients. In causal inference, confounding variables are factors that are related to both the independent variable and the dependent variable, leading to a spurious association. OLS cannot account for these confounders, and therefore, the estimated coefficients may not accurately reflect the true causal effect.\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, OLS assumes linearity and additivity of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. However, in many real-world scenarios, the relationship may be nonlinear or involve interactions between variables. OLS may fail to capture these complexities, leading to inaccurate estimates of causality.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, OLS relies on the assumption of no endogeneity, which means that the independent variables are not correlated with the error term in the regression model. Endogeneity can arise when there is reverse causality or simultaneous causality between the variables. If endogeneity is present, the OLS coefficients may be biased and cannot be interpreted as causal effects.\\\\n\\\\nTo determine causality using OLS coefficients, it is important to consider additional methods and techniques. One approach is to conduct robustness checks by including additional control variables to address potential confounding. Another approach is to use instrumental variable (IV) regression, which can help address endogeneity by finding an instrument that is correlated with the independent variable but not directly with the dependent variable. IV regression allows for estimating causal effects even in the presence of endogeneity.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, while OLS regression can provide valuable insights into associations between variables, it is not always sufficient for determining causality. To establish causality, it is important to consider the limitations of OLS and employ additional methods that address confounding and endogeneity.\",\\n  \"sources\": [\"data/Causal_Inference_in_Python.pdf\"]\\n}'"
