    "# Ways to load a PDF document\n",

    "### Using PyPDF\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPDF is a popular library used to work with PDF files in Python. It can be used to extract text, metadata, and other information from PDF documents. Here's how Langchain utilizes PyPDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading PDFs**: PyPDF is used to load PDF documents into an array of documents, where each document contains the page content and metadata with the page number.\n",
    "- **Installation**: PyPDF can be installed using `pip install pypdf`.\n",
    "- **Usage**: PyPDFLoader is used to load and split the PDF into pages, and the content can be accessed as shown in the code snippet on the webpage.\n",
    "- **Advantage**: An advantage of using PyPDF is that documents can be retrieved with page numbers, allowing for easy navigation and reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Unstructured\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured is another method mentioned on the webpage for loading PDF documents. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading PDFs**: UnstructuredPDFLoader is used to load PDF documents.\n",
    "- **Elements Handling**: Under the hood, Unstructured creates different \"elements\" for different chunks of text. By default, these are combined together, but separation can be maintained by specifying `mode=\"elements\"`.\n",
    "- **Usage**: UnstructuredPDFLoader is used to load the PDF, and the content can be accessed similarly to PyPDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use PyPDF vs. Unstructured\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PyPDF**:\n",
    "  - **When Page Numbers are Important**: If you need to keep track of page numbers and want to work with individual pages, PyPDF is a suitable choice.\n",
    "  - **General Text Extraction**: PyPDF is widely used for general text extraction from PDF documents and has a well-established community.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unstructured**:\n",
    "  - **Handling Different Text Elements**: If you need to work with different chunks of text and want to retain the separation between different elements, Unstructured might be a better option.\n",
    "  - **Customized Text Processing**: Unstructured allows for more customized handling of text elements, making it suitable for specific use cases where text needs to be processed in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between PyPDF and Unstructured depends on the specific requirements of your task. If you need general text extraction with page numbers, PyPDF is a solid choice. If you require more customized handling of text elements, Unstructured might be more suitable. Both methods are supported by Langchain, allowing for flexibility in handling PDF documents."
